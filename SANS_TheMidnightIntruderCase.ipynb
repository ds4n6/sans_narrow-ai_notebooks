    "__NOTE__: The '_Error_' parameter indicates the anomaly level, where 100% signifies a highly anomalous movement and 0% indicates minimal anomaly. Keep in mind that most machine learning models include a stochastic component, meaning that running the model multiple times can yield different outcomes. Nonetheless, if you run the model several times, you'll notice that the results tend to be quite similar."
